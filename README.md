# DemoShop — Simple Client-Side E‑Commerce Demo

This is a small demo e-commerce site built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Files added:
- `index.html` — main page (updated)
- `app.css` — site styling
- `app.js` — product data, rendering, cart behavior, localStorage persistence

How to run:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use "Open with" in your editor).
2. Browse products, use the search and filters, add items to cart using "Add to cart".
3. Open the cart (🛒) to adjust quantities, clear, or checkout.

Notes:
- This is a static demo: checkout is simulated in the browser (no payments).
- Cart contents persist across page reloads using `localStorage`.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add product detail modals.
- Implement a persistent backend (Node/Express) to store orders.
- Add images to the repo and improve responsive styles.
